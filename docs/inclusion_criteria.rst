Inclusion Criteria
==================

Similarly to the `Sklearn's inclusion criteria <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#what-are-the-inclusion-criteria-for-new-algorithms>`_ and `PyOD inclusion criteria`_, we include well-established models with at least 50+ citations.

We encourage researchers to share their code in a format that can be used through PySAD framework, i.e., extending :class:`pysad.core.base_model`_. We are open to promote these models through documentation. For any questions, you may open issue on Github or drop me an email at `yilmaselimfirat (at)gmail(you know the rest)`.
