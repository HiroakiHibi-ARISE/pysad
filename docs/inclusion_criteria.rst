Inclusion Criteria
==================

Similarly to the `Sklearn's inclusion criteria <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#what-are-the-inclusion-criteria-for-new-algorithms>`_ and `PyOD inclusion criteria <https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#inclusion-criteria>`_, we include well-established models with at least 50+ citations.

We encourage researchers to share their code in a format that can be used through PySAD framework, i.e., extending :class:`pysad.core.base_model`. We are open to promote these models through documentation. For any questions, you may open issue on Github or email to `yilmaselimfirat (at) gmail`.
